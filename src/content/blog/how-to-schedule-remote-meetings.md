Remote work is now the global standard — but coordinating meetings across time zones? That’s where the real challenge begins.

## 🧠 Why Time Zones Are a Meeting Nightmare

Imagine this: It’s 10 AM for you, but your teammate is winding down their day at 8 PM. One misstep and half your team either misses the meeting or logs in half-asleep.

Common issues:
- Overlapping working hours are minimal
- Daylight Saving Time (DST) differences
- Time zone miscalculations due to conversions

## 🔧 Tools to Make It Easier

These tools simplify the process:

- Google Calendar – auto-adjusts time zones.
- World Time Buddy or Every Time Zone – visual overlap planners.

## 🕒 Best Practices to Follow

1. **Set a standard time anchor** (like UTC or GMT).
2. **Use scheduling polls** (e.g., Doodle) to find optimal slots.
3. **Rotate meeting times** to share inconvenience fairly.
4. **Avoid early mornings or late nights** unless necessary.
