**Tired of forgetting when to unplug your laptop? Worried about damaging your battery over time?**  
Introducing **ChargeDose**, a mindful battery care tool built by the team behind [What’s The Time](https://whatsthetime.online).

With the launch of **ChargeDose v2.0**, we're expanding from timezones into your laptop's **lifespan** — quite literally.

## 💡 Why ChargeDose Exists

Laptop batteries wear out faster due to overcharging or deep draining. Many users unknowingly keep their chargers plugged in 24/7 — damaging lithium-ion cells and reducing capacity permanently.

While some high-end laptops offer built-in charge limits, most users don’t get that feature. That’s where ChargeDose comes in:

> “ChargeDose is like a friend who gently taps your shoulder when it’s time to unplug or plug in the charger.”

## ⚙️ How ChargeDose Works

Once installed, ChargeDose runs quietly in your system tray. It checks your battery percentage and power status every few seconds and intelligently reminds you when:

- Your battery **exceeds 80%** while charging (time to unplug)
- Your battery **drops below 20%** while on battery (time to plug in)

No heavy GUI, no system bloat — just a minimal, respectful assistant for battery care.
